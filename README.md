What is Bytecoin?
----------------

Bytecoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bytecoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bytecoin is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bytecoin client sofware, see https://bytecoin.biz.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Bytecoin
development team members simply pulls it.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `main` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bytecoin-crypto/bytecoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bytecoin.
